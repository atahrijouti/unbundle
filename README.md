# unbundle

Goals for this tool :

- The web, imho, was built on **Mouse Right Button Click** > **View Source**, and for the source to actually look like code you can read, and have the oppotunity to learn from it even as a visitor to the website. Let alone being able to easily debug things when you're the one developing it...
- I do not like bundling.
- It's 2025.
- I like my live reload to go brrr.
- I like for my production builds to end sometimes this year.
- The current Web APIs have evolved so much I would like to argue that we can do a lot more without a view library for static websites.
- It's fun not to have to use webpack.

Currently mixing Bun, ESbuild and a smattering of string replacing in a big html template. Very early stages.
